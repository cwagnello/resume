      <ul>
        <li>Performed all steps in regard to the Software Development Life Cycle, vetted requirements with the Product team, designed, implemented new features/fixed bugs, did code reviews for team mates, wrote unit tests, wrote BDD tests based on acceptance criteria in Cucumber, performed releases, managed code repository, and periodically was on-call</li>
        <li>Created a new webservice (to replace a legacy system) that is part of the new Open Platform initiative
        <li>Triaged incoming issues to gather more data, to learn more about the underlying backend systems, and to gauge priority of the issue</li>
        <li>Monitored onsales for key events to ensure that all systems are operating smoothly and to act quickly when/if any problems occurred</li>
        <li>Gathered accurate timing data for methods using Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) point cuts based on AspectJ</li>
        <li>Created reports generated by Splunk for the API traffic showing aggregate data, errors broken down by endpoint and channel, and other statistics</li>
        <li>Worked as a member of the Abuse Prevention team to monitor, investigate, and decide any future mitigation of bot traffic. Also collected data for the legal team in regard to the automated use</li>
